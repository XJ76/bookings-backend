# Bookings Backend Project Overview

The Bookings Backend serves as the foundational infrastructure for a comprehensive booking system designed to manage and facilitate various services including events, activities, meal plans, and accommodations. This backend system is built using Node.js and Express, leveraging MongoDB as its database through Mongoose for data modeling.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Implements secure user registration and login processes, including password hashing with bcrypt and token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Data Validation and Management:** Utilizes express-validator for robust validation of input data to ensure integrity and reliability of the system.
- **Modular Architecture:** Organized into modular routes and controllers for different entities such as clients and admins, promoting ease of maintenance and scalability.
- **Comprehensive Models:** Defines detailed Mongoose schemas for various entities like accommodations, events, and users, aligning with the frontend's requirements for seamless integration.
- **Environment Configuration:** Configures environment variables for secure and flexible management of sensitive information like database credentials and JWT secrets.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Configured to enable CORS, allowing the frontend to interact with the backend from different origins.

## Technical Stack

- **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **ODM:** Mongoose
- **Authentication:** bcrypt for hashing, JWT for token management
- **Other Libraries:** dotenv for environment variable management, cors for handling cross-origin requests

This backend system is designed to be robust, secure, and scalable, providing a solid foundation for the bookings project and its various modules.
